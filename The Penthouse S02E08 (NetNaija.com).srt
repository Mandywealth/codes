1
00:00:10,234 --> 00:00:12,187
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

2
00:00:12,575 --> 00:00:14,055
Bring Ms. Oh to the study.

3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,961
She's already waiting inside.

4
00:00:17,764 --> 00:00:18,764
What?

5
00:00:46,241 --> 00:00:48,111
<i>Looking over here</i>

6
00:00:49,451 --> 00:00:51,481
<i>And over there</i>

7
00:00:53,251 --> 00:00:55,221
<i>But I still can't see</i>

8
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,790
<i>Yoon Hee</i>

9
00:01:26,381 --> 00:01:29,021
She looks too much like Su Ryeon.

10
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:43,329
It's you?

11
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,130
Did you come for me?

12
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,030
Of course.

13
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:53,540
What a surprise.

14
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,670
I missed you.

15
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:05,049
Father, may I come in?

16
00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:15,960
What is it?

17
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,700
Ro Na's mom came by and left.

18
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,769
She had to go because she had
an urgent matter to take care of.

19
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:23,469
Ms. Ahn said that she didn't see her
walking out of the house.

20
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:25,370
Oh, I saw her.

21
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,409
She told me to tell you.

22
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:32,239
All right, then. Go and study.

23
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,889
- Ms. Oh, where are you?
- What?

24
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,629
My father is home. I told him
that you left. Just so you know.

25
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,229
Thank you, Seok Hoon.

26
00:02:57,999 --> 00:03:01,409
I didn't expect you to just come
out of the blue like this.

27
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:04,280
Aren't you the one in a rush?

28
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,050
I'm here to give you the contract
for the Gangnam properties.

29
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:11,749
You know that...

30
00:03:11,749 --> 00:03:16,120
I own half of
these properties, right?

31
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:21,390
We're going to half it precisely.

32
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,060
Don't you dare
play any tricks on me.

33
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,229
Once I open my mouth,

34
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:32,539
your name will be gone.

35
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,469
Don't you forget.

36
00:03:35,469 --> 00:03:38,140
Na Ae Gyo, do you think
I won't know you well enough?

37
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,580
I've seen you since you were 10.

38
00:03:41,949 --> 00:03:43,919
I don't trust anything...

39
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:46,120
except for the money in my hands.

40
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,120
Not even you,

41
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:51,289
or me.

42
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:56,629
Isn't life too lonely for you
if you don't even trust me?

43
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:00,599
I only have you.

44
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,539
My lifelong dream is to live
a happy life with you...

45
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:06,439
in this penthouse forever.

46
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,610
We're almost there.

47
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,949
I guess I'm getting suspicious
for no reason again.

48
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,650
I was crazy lonely
when I was in Thailand.

49
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:23,289
- Is that right?
- Yes.

50
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:25,319
Here.

51
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,759
Thank you.

52
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,999
Great.

53
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:39,199
I'm leaving.
My taxi is waiting for me.

54
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,310
No, take mine.

55
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,180
It's fine.

56
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,849
I'm going to disappear
so that nobody will know.

57
00:05:12,969 --> 00:05:14,270
Na Ae Gyo?

58
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,179
Look for Na Ae Gyo.

59
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,809
She knows
all of Joo Dan Tae's secrets.

60
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,960
(Premium taxi)

61
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:35,719
Who are you?
And how dare you follow me?

62
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:37,489
Su Ryeon!

63
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,090
You were alive?

64
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:44,229
Su Ryeon.

65
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:47,030
It's me. Don't you recognize me?

66
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,969
How would I know you?

67
00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:50,539
You're Su Ryeon.

68
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:52,400
Don't you remember me?

69
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,669
Why are you lying?

70
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:55,369
Are you dense?

71
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,739
I don't know you or anyone like you.

72
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:01,510
You freak.

73
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,750
Wait. Let's talk.

74
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:11,960
(Na Ae Gyo)

75
00:07:13,429 --> 00:07:14,489
Satisfied?

76
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:18,929
I'm sorry.

77
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,070
You look so much
like someone I know.

78
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,539
Don't touch my things.

79
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,250
(Installed)

80
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:47,789
(Premium Taxi)

81
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:49,700
Wait a second.

82
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,200
Your phone.

83
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:56,469
You're so annoying.

84
00:07:56,669 --> 00:07:57,869
I'm sorry.

85
00:07:58,739 --> 00:07:59,909
I'm sorry.

86
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,219
Logan. I found Na Ae Gyo.

87
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,059
Where? I'll come right away.

88
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:18,890
I installed the tracking app,

89
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,059
so I'll contact you
once I confirm where she's staying.

90
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:23,929
Okay then. Call me.

91
00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:25,299
I'll be waiting.

92
00:08:30,799 --> 00:08:33,039
I'm sorry Su Ryeon...

93
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,309
for coming so late.

94
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,780
What are those bags?

95
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,079
Let's stop.

96
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,549
I left the divorce papers there.

97
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,220
(Petition for Uncontested Divorce)

98
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,689
(Ha Yoon Chul)

99
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,829
Why must we do that?

100
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,100
I've lost interest in the revenge.

101
00:09:38,299 --> 00:09:39,370
Look at us.

102
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:41,770
You've lost Ro Na,

103
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,709
and I've only hurt Eun Byeol.

104
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,510
I can't do it anymore.

105
00:09:47,049 --> 00:09:48,079
So...

106
00:09:49,819 --> 00:09:51,650
Must you do this right now?

107
00:09:56,419 --> 00:09:58,319
I buried Ro Na...

108
00:09:59,289 --> 00:10:00,929
only four days ago.

109
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,569
It was a contract marriage anyway.

110
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:10,370
What do you expect
from someone like me?

111
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,600
It's all for show.

112
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:16,370
Did you want me to be
a real husband or something?

113
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,409
Go in. Yes!

114
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,819
Nice. How did you get that in?

115
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:31,520
Get it together.

116
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,189
You're only giving them
what they want.

117
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:36,329
Why are you back?

118
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:39,030
I said to stop coming.

119
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,980
Look.

120
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,010
See that?

121
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,850
Thanks to that scumbag Joo Dan Tae,

122
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,220
I can't even be a doctor anymore.

123
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,449
So what can I do?

124
00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:01,949
My life is a mess already.

125
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,220
I should be a mess to match.

126
00:11:07,429 --> 00:11:08,530
Yoon Chul.

127
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,429
Let's go back to Korea.

128
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,429
Let's go and get revenge...

129
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,169
on Joo Dan Tae and Seo Jin.

130
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,100
Together.

131
00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:21,740
Yoon Hee.

132
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:24,939
You and I've lost.

133
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,280
We were shut out.

134
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,510
What can we do?

135
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,650
No hospital...

136
00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:33,990
will take me
even if I do go back to Korea.

137
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,689
No one will welcome you either.

138
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,260
Why can't you start over?

139
00:11:41,789 --> 00:11:43,329
Start a business, get a job...

140
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,929
Do something. I'll help you.

141
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,799
We've been to
the world of torment and back.

142
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,339
We have nothing to fear.

143
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,240
Joo Dan Tae and Seo Jin...

144
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,240
are getting engaged soon.

145
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,929
I wanted revenge...

146
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:17,400
because I still loved Seo Jin.

147
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,959
Because I couldn't let go.

148
00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:20,829
I just realized...

149
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,539
that I'm catching
feelings for Seo Jin again.

150
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:26,199
Do you feel better...

151
00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:28,809
if you say that?

152
00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:35,549
Are you stupid?

153
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,020
Are you dense or playing stupid?

154
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:40,189
I wanted to use you...

155
00:12:40,189 --> 00:12:42,750
to build a successful business
and show off to Seo Jin.

156
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,020
I used you.

157
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,990
I can never let her go.

158
00:12:46,659 --> 00:12:49,230
That's the piece of trash that I am!

159
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,270
You jerk.

160
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,709
I'll move out...

161
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:10,679
until the divorce is finalized.

162
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:20,429
Ro Na...

163
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:25,929
liked you so much.

164
00:13:27,669 --> 00:13:29,400
1, 2...

165
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,799
You should get in too.

166
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,939
- What?
- Get in the picture with us.

167
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:37,610
But... Shall I?

168
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,150
Excuse me.
Would you take our picture for us?

169
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,449
Sure.

170
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,620
Here we go.

171
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,049
1, 2...

172
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,579
What's with the bag?

173
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:45,339
Are you going somewhere this late?

174
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:48,579
You're not... No, right?

175
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,650
You didn't fight in the midst of
all this, did you?

176
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:56,319
Even still, how could a man
pack his things and leave home?

177
00:14:56,319 --> 00:14:57,760
Is that it?

178
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:01,089
Let go. Stay out of
other people's affairs.

179
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:02,459
"Other people"?

180
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:05,799
Yoon Hee is like a sister to me.

181
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:08,600
You're running away
because of your guilty conscience.

182
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,370
I said to stay out of it!

183
00:15:10,539 --> 00:15:11,600
Oh my gosh.

184
00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:15,510
You... You'd better not be
getting any ideas.

185
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,280
I'll kill you myself.

186
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:23,110
I keep hearing a strange melody.

187
00:15:23,409 --> 00:15:28,350
<i>Mi fa sol fa mi mi mi re ti re mi</i>

188
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,360
Everything is a mess.

189
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,089
With Ro Na's death...

190
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:34,760
Mom retiring...

191
00:15:35,429 --> 00:15:38,360
Everything in my head is jumbled.
It's driving me crazy.

192
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,329
You still can't remember
anything from that day?

193
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,500
I can't remember anything...

194
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,339
other than what Mom told me.

195
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,970
It'll come back to you slowly.

196
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,339
Don't be anxious.

197
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,380
Ro Na died...

198
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,179
without even knowing
that she won the grand prize.

199
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:58,280
She was punished for coveting
something that wasn't hers.

200
00:15:59,179 --> 00:16:01,720
I'll sleep with you
until you fall asleep.

201
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,360
She's coming.

202
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,900
Cheon Seo Jin.

203
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,260
How do you feel about being expelled
permanently from the Vocal Society?

204
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,169
There's a rumor
that your ghost singer...

205
00:16:15,169 --> 00:16:16,970
was your high school classmate.
Is that true?

206
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,299
Did you know that Cheong A scheduled
an emergency board meeting...

207
00:16:19,299 --> 00:16:20,709
to discuss your removal?

208
00:16:21,669 --> 00:16:22,740
Please say a few words.

209
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,339
Please get in.

210
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:26,039
Please save a few words
before you get in.

211
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:27,750
- Cheon Seo Jin.
- Cheon Seo Jin.

212
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,750
Is it true?

213
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,280
- Please say something!
- Please say a few words.

214
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,650
- Is it true?
- How do you feel?

215
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:34,850
Cheon Seo Jin.

216
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,260
You're holding an emergency
board meeting without telling me?

217
00:16:41,429 --> 00:16:42,829
You disgraced the family.

218
00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:44,260
How dare you raise your voice?

219
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:47,270
You don't deserve
Cheong A Foundation.

220
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,370
You damaged
your father's reputation.

221
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,669
Hand over
Cheong A Foundation to me now.

222
00:16:51,669 --> 00:16:55,809
I'll take good care of Cheong A
Art Center too, so don't worry.

223
00:16:56,809 --> 00:17:00,709
My in-laws can pull some strings
so you can avoid being arrested.

224
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,819
Don't be absurd.
I don't need your help.

225
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:08,650
Also, forget about
Cheong A Art Center.

226
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:11,890
Not a single brick or stair was
laid without my supervision.

227
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,789
Stop being greedy.

228
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:16,459
This is the last time
you'll see me as your mom.

229
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:19,699
If you don't stop,
we'll have to meet in court.

230
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,169
Go as far as you want.

231
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,169
This is the last time
I'll treat you as my mother.

232
00:17:28,539 --> 00:17:30,679
Unless Father comes back alive
and takes my place,

233
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:32,209
I won't step down.

234
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,049
Cheong A Foundation is...

235
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,520
the last present
that Father left me.

236
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,079
You're not allowed
to be in a crowded place.

237
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:16,389
So? Am I supposed to be stuck
in the woods all day?

238
00:18:16,389 --> 00:18:18,359
I'll drive you
to your accommodation.

239
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,260
It's Chairman Joo's order.

240
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:33,910
Get lost.

241
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:39,710
Anyone who is stupid enough
to lay a finger on me...

242
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,379
should be prepared
to become crippled.

243
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,230
Eun Byeol.

244
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,000
Do you want breakfast?

245
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,539
Should I make you a sandwich?

246
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:09,869
Ms. Jin, could you make
some juice for me?

247
00:19:09,869 --> 00:19:11,639
I'll do it.

248
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,079
How do I make it?

249
00:19:14,349 --> 00:19:16,379
Did I ask you to act like a mom?

250
00:19:16,379 --> 00:19:18,079
You're annoying.

251
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,889
Eun Byeol!

252
00:19:23,089 --> 00:19:24,589
She's a bit on edge.

253
00:19:24,589 --> 00:19:26,960
I'll pack some snacks for her,
so don't worry.

254
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:07,869
What do you mean?

255
00:20:08,369 --> 00:20:10,770
Things don't seem right
at Cheong A Group?

256
00:20:11,569 --> 00:20:15,309
Even the stockholders on your side
seem to have turned their backs.

257
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:17,839
The recent event must have
damaged their trust in me.

258
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,210
It'll take a while to recover.

259
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,210
You shouldn't sit back and watch.

260
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:25,649
A few days ago,
Chairman Joo met with...

261
00:20:25,649 --> 00:20:27,619
Cheong A's
major stockholders alone.

262
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,619
What are you talking about?

263
00:20:31,619 --> 00:20:33,490
You shouldn't trust him too much.

264
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,960
He was aware
of your ghost singer deal.

265
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,700
Even the fact that
the singer was Ms. Oh.

266
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,599
What did you say?

267
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:45,099
How could he possibly know that?

268
00:20:46,569 --> 00:20:48,369
It's all my fault.

269
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:51,410
I fell into his trap.

270
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,649
Punish me.

271
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,649
I'll accept
whatever decision you make.

272
00:21:04,859 --> 00:21:07,190
Joo Dan Tae knew?

273
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,020
(Noise control)

274
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,730
Sit down, everyone.

275
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:56,210
Let me announce a decision that was
made at today's teachers' meeting.

276
00:21:56,339 --> 00:21:59,109
As Bae Ro Na, who won
the grand prize...

277
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,250
at Cheong A Art Festival,
is deceased,

278
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:04,780
the principal will recommend
the second prize winner,

279
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:07,619
Joo Seok Kyung, to Seoul
National University instead.

280
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,190
Seok Kyung will be recommended
to Seoul National University?

281
00:22:12,859 --> 00:22:14,660
That's unbelievable.

282
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,329
(187 days to performance test,
221 days to CSAT)

283
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,230
The midterms have started.

284
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,569
Your grades in your senior year
are extremely important.

285
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:23,399
Leave all the
distracting events behind...

286
00:22:23,399 --> 00:22:26,069
and focus on your studies, okay?

287
00:22:26,069 --> 00:22:27,569
- Okay.
- Okay.

288
00:22:27,569 --> 00:22:32,109
On that note, why don't we
put those flowers away already?

289
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,210
I think we've mourned enough.

290
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:36,180
Okay. I'll put them away.

291
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,220
Get your hands off.

292
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:45,490
Whoever even touches the flowers...

293
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,930
is dead meat.

294
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:53,000
Eun Woo, have you lost your mind?

295
00:22:53,129 --> 00:22:54,869
I completely agree with Seok Hoon.

296
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:57,000
Guys, how can you be so cold?

297
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,770
Your classmate is dead. How come
no one seems to genuinely grieve?

298
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,940
Seok Hoon, where are you going?

299
00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:07,750
Oh, you're leaving early today?

300
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,410
Be careful on your way. "I will."

301
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:11,579
That's my boy.

302
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:14,450
What are you guys looking at?
Open your books.

303
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:17,490
(Bae Ro Na)

304
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,260
(Chocolate Milk)

305
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,170
(Chocolate Milk)

306
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,670
Thanks for the milk, Ro Na.
I appreciate it.

307
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,210
Sure.

308
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,339
Why are you keeping this?

309
00:23:55,629 --> 00:23:57,030
It's good.

310
00:24:04,139 --> 00:24:05,740
Isn't it cold?

311
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:08,970
I'll be back tomorrow.

312
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:13,609
- I'm not...
- You'll change your mind.

313
00:24:15,349 --> 00:24:17,319
What are you doing outside my door?

314
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,579
Oh, there you are.

315
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:24,990
I was so disappointed,
thinking you were away.

316
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,460
You know what a great cook
Ms. Wang is, right?

317
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:30,460
I asked her to make
your favorite dishes.

318
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,899
Do you want to try?

319
00:24:31,899 --> 00:24:34,099
- I'm busy.
- With what?

320
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:35,799
It's none of your business.

321
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:38,799
Can I tag along?

322
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:41,410
Are you on your way to meet
the Three Queens?

323
00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:45,510
Forget it.
I can see right through you.

324
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:48,079
It really takes
all my appetite away.

325
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:50,750
You're making my place
smell like food.

326
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,619
Take it and leave.

327
00:24:55,649 --> 00:24:59,520
That vulgar woman.
How dare she talk to me that way?

328
00:25:01,329 --> 00:25:03,760
I should be patient.

329
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:07,260
I should put up with this
for Kyu Jin's sake.

330
00:25:07,369 --> 00:25:10,770
Okay. Watch and learn.

331
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:13,440
First, hold the brush firmly.

332
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,670
And brush thoroughly.

333
00:25:15,869 --> 00:25:18,280
- Ms. Kang.
- To remove water stains,

334
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,510
use quick, short movements.

335
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,410
Otherwise, you'll sprain your wrist.

336
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:25,849
Why are you just standing there?

337
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,619
The cold bath is yours.

338
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:31,589
If you don't do a proper job,
you won't get paid.

339
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,289
Hurry up!

340
00:25:43,099 --> 00:25:46,940
Don't forget the corners.
Brush thoroughly.

341
00:25:47,369 --> 00:25:49,010
- Okay.
- Good.

342
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:52,079
Hold the brush firmly
using your wrist and arm.

343
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:53,210
Okay.

344
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:55,079
There you go. You can do this.

345
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:59,049
Let's do this. We can do this.

346
00:25:59,049 --> 00:26:02,720
<i>When things get tough,
look up at the sky</i>

347
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,690
<i>You're never alone</i>

348
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:10,859
<i>After heavy rain and strong winds</i>

349
00:26:10,859 --> 00:26:15,829
<i>- The sun will shine again
- The sun will shine again</i>

350
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:20,240
- Good!
<i>- When it hurts too much</i>

351
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:24,710
<i>Give a loud shout</i>

352
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:29,149
<i>Make the weak sadness</i>

353
00:26:29,149 --> 00:26:33,079
<i>Run away from you</i>

354
00:26:36,589 --> 00:26:38,589
Here. Dig in.

355
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:43,089
Jajangmyeon tastes best
at a bathhouse.

356
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,200
I'm...

357
00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:48,500
hungry.

358
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,970
How dare I, right?

359
00:26:51,099 --> 00:26:53,639
Whether you lost
your husband or your child,

360
00:26:53,639 --> 00:26:56,210
it's not a sin to feed yourself.

361
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,309
Eat up.

362
00:26:58,379 --> 00:27:00,339
You must feel shattered inside.

363
00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:03,950
I saw Mr. Ha, no,

364
00:27:04,149 --> 00:27:07,619
that punk, pack his things
and leave.

365
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,589
It doesn't just look
like it was a small argument.

366
00:27:11,859 --> 00:27:14,389
Does he want to get a divorce?

367
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:20,460
Are you serious?

368
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:24,030
That despicable jerk!

369
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,440
Humans show their true selves
when they're at their worst.

370
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,609
How can he turn his back on you...

371
00:27:29,609 --> 00:27:30,839
after seeing you faint?

372
00:27:32,579 --> 00:27:34,680
The jjajangmyeon is getting cold.
Eat up.

373
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,680
I can't possibly say anything
to comfort...

374
00:27:38,849 --> 00:27:40,720
a woman who's lost her child.

375
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:44,760
You have to stay strong.

376
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,460
You have to stand your ground.

377
00:27:50,899 --> 00:27:52,660
That's what Ro Na wants.

378
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,099
You know what I mean, right?

379
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:07,079
I'm going to survive somehow.

380
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:10,950
I'll get through this somehow.

381
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,629
Yes.

382
00:28:28,129 --> 00:28:32,139
Aren't these noodles amazing?

383
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,780
Look at her.

384
00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:45,549
What?

385
00:28:49,049 --> 00:28:50,049
That's hilarious.

386
00:28:52,889 --> 00:28:55,289
(A fake junior soprano,
Ha Eun Byeol)

387
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,559
Who is it?

388
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,670
How dare you all act like kids?

389
00:29:05,139 --> 00:29:07,139
I heard that Ms. Cheon is getting
fired from her Director position.

390
00:29:07,569 --> 00:29:09,109
What a strong girl you are.

391
00:29:09,339 --> 00:29:11,079
Your mom is about to go to jail,

392
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:12,339
but you're here to memorize
some English vocabulary?

393
00:29:12,339 --> 00:29:15,349
Shouldn't you apologize to us
on behalf of your mom?

394
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,819
You're fake too.

395
00:29:18,349 --> 00:29:21,190
It was always so annoying
to see you be a brat...

396
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:23,289
when you're not even talented.

397
00:29:23,289 --> 00:29:26,819
To be honest, Bae Ro Na was
so much better than you.

398
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:27,990
You know that, right?

399
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,960
Go away. Get out of my way!

400
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,869
- What are you doing?
- Go away!

401
00:29:42,069 --> 00:29:45,379
Why did you guys keep
a dead girl's desk? That's bad luck!

402
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,309
Watch what you say. Bad luck?

403
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,710
Why?

404
00:29:50,809 --> 00:29:53,220
Don't you dare talk like that
when she had such a sad death!

405
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,049
Did you just slap me?

406
00:29:55,049 --> 00:29:56,289
How dare you?

407
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,359
Jenny is right.

408
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,559
I feel bad for Ro Na.

409
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:05,559
Joo Seok Kyung, you think you have
a right to say that?

410
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,460
Why not?

411
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:09,970
Was I the one who killed her?

412
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,869
I've been meaning to ask you.

413
00:30:14,339 --> 00:30:16,609
You were with Ro Na
during the awards announcement...

414
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,309
at Cheong A Arts Festival,
weren't you?

415
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,849
No. I didn't see her.

416
00:30:21,849 --> 00:30:23,950
You and Ro Na were the only two
who were missing.

417
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,849
Tell me. What were you doing
and where were you?

418
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:33,559
I was...

419
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,190
You overdosed on medicine,

420
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,460
so you were lying down
at the infirmary.

421
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:43,099
Then, you passed out
right before the announcement,

422
00:30:43,099 --> 00:30:45,139
so Secretary Do took you home.

423
00:30:46,299 --> 00:30:47,809
I was at the infirmary...

424
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,339
because all the pills I took
that day made me dizzy.

425
00:30:51,109 --> 00:30:53,510
Are you sure? Really?

426
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:54,980
Any witnesses?

427
00:31:37,889 --> 00:31:38,889
Are you okay?

428
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,359
Seok Hoon!

429
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:48,099
What happened?

430
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,500
You suddenly passed out in class.

431
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:56,440
My head feels like
it's going to burst.

432
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,920
I don't think you're feeling well.

433
00:32:09,149 --> 00:32:11,389
I heard that you passed out
during Cheong A Arts Festival too.

434
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:14,789
Yes, I did.

435
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,559
I'm a little disappointed...

436
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:25,569
that you don't seem to remember
what happened on that day.

437
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:32,079
Don't you remember what you told me
by the stairs?

438
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,510
What did I say to you?

439
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,879
You really don't remember?

440
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:41,619
Hearing you say that was
what made me ask you out.

441
00:32:42,649 --> 00:32:43,720
Because I liked what you said.

442
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,660
I'll get going.

443
00:32:52,899 --> 00:32:54,129
Seok Hoon!

444
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:10,250
What did I tell him here?

445
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,549
I can't remember anything!

446
00:33:18,889 --> 00:33:20,490
Get your memories back,
Ha Eun Byeol.

447
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,289
Recall what you've done.

448
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:39,980
What a pleasant surprise, Ms. Oh.

449
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:42,010
I didn't expect you to come
and see me.

450
00:33:43,379 --> 00:33:44,819
As you know,

451
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:47,619
there's nobody I can rely on.

452
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,220
I was thinking,

453
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:53,260
and I thought of you, who treated
me like your younger sibling.

454
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:56,690
I'm known to be the assemblyman
who listens to his people.

455
00:33:57,089 --> 00:34:00,230
Not only that, we're like siblings.

456
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,470
I'm even more all ears for you.

457
00:34:03,329 --> 00:34:04,329
Look at me.

458
00:34:04,899 --> 00:34:06,139
You trust me, right?

459
00:34:06,569 --> 00:34:08,210
Tell me everything.

460
00:34:10,569 --> 00:34:12,579
What do I do now?

461
00:34:20,549 --> 00:34:22,149
Hey!

462
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:29,059
No!

463
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:32,859
Hey.

464
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,809
I totally saw that coming.

465
00:34:41,809 --> 00:34:43,609
I just had a feeling.

466
00:34:43,609 --> 00:34:47,240
Recently, I ran into
Ha Yoon Chul late at night.

467
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,849
I talked slightly bad
about Seo Jin,

468
00:34:49,849 --> 00:34:51,319
then, he said,

469
00:34:51,319 --> 00:34:53,819
"If you're drunk, shut up
and go to sleep."

470
00:34:53,819 --> 00:34:55,689
"Don't blabber nonsense."

471
00:34:55,689 --> 00:34:56,919
That's what he said.

472
00:34:56,919 --> 00:34:58,019
They were already divorced,

473
00:34:58,019 --> 00:35:00,060
so I couldn't understand why
he was being so defensive.

474
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:03,229
Everything makes sense now.

475
00:35:03,229 --> 00:35:05,299
What a trashy man he is!

476
00:35:05,299 --> 00:35:07,729
You know, even cheaters have rules.

477
00:35:07,729 --> 00:35:09,700
If anyone's going to cheat, they
must cheat with a stranger.

478
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,769
If they don't know a stranger,
I can introduce one to them.

479
00:35:12,999 --> 00:35:15,669
You know, something like a pen pal.

480
00:35:15,669 --> 00:35:18,410
But he cheated on you
with his ex-wife?

481
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,040
He's insane!

482
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,109
I don't even know what to think.

483
00:35:23,109 --> 00:35:24,410
This divorce came so suddenly.

484
00:35:27,049 --> 00:35:28,490
It's me.

485
00:35:28,589 --> 00:35:30,149
Don't worry.

486
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:33,990
I was so well-off
as a divorce lawyer.

487
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:37,490
All you need to do is
to do what I tell you.

488
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,870
What am I supposed to do?

489
00:35:45,299 --> 00:35:47,439
The key to a divorce is...

490
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:49,269
the reason for divorce.

491
00:35:49,269 --> 00:35:51,169
First, you need to start
by gathering proof...

492
00:35:51,169 --> 00:35:53,040
that he's cheating on you
with Seo Jin.

493
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,979
I'll introduce you...

494
00:35:55,979 --> 00:35:57,910
to a very good ex-colleague
who's a divorce lawyer.

495
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:00,819
You've lost so much weight!

496
00:36:03,749 --> 00:36:08,260
Does Joo Dan Tae know
this important news or what?

497
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:12,999
Don't stop yourself. Go, run.

498
00:36:12,999 --> 00:36:15,399
I only want one thing from you.

499
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:19,769
You ladies are paying
for my paycheck.

500
00:36:19,769 --> 00:36:21,370
You pay taxes, right?

501
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:22,709
Thank you all.

502
00:36:22,709 --> 00:36:25,280
I don't have anything to give
but this. Here you go.

503
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,519
Assemblyman Lee, why are we
meeting up at a place like this?

504
00:36:37,589 --> 00:36:39,120
Looks like you got yourself
some bonus.

505
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,729
I'm going to enjoy the night
since you're paying.

506
00:36:41,729 --> 00:36:43,330
Don't stop me. Okay?

507
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:45,760
Order us something
expensive and amazing.

508
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,430
I don't owe you anything, though.

509
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:49,129
You will soon enough.

510
00:36:49,129 --> 00:36:51,439
Have a glass.

511
00:36:51,439 --> 00:36:53,839
What is it that you're
stalling so much?

512
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:58,580
My mom told me that patience is
the key to making good rice.

513
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,140
Just wait.

514
00:37:00,479 --> 00:37:03,580
I have a special relationship
with Seo Jin, as you know.

515
00:37:03,609 --> 00:37:06,519
We attended the private
English kindergarten together,

516
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:09,950
and were neighbors
when we first moved...

517
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:12,120
into Simoon Mansion.

518
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,560
Stop playing around
and just tell me.

519
00:37:15,189 --> 00:37:19,030
Ha Yoon Chul and Oh Yoon Hee
are getting a divorce.

520
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:22,269
- Why?
- Why would they?

521
00:37:22,399 --> 00:37:24,769
Isn't this man so thick-headed?

522
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,240
Because of Seo Jin, of course.

523
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:33,080
Ha Yoon Chul and Seo Jin...

524
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,549
are back together.

525
00:37:44,149 --> 00:37:49,490
Why don't you tell me more,
since you're not thick-headed?

526
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:15,437
I think you should spend some time
away from the company.

527
00:38:16,098 --> 00:38:18,167
We need to calm down
the stockholders first.

528
00:38:19,037 --> 00:38:22,307
Why didn't you discuss it
with me earlier?

529
00:38:22,307 --> 00:38:25,008
You didn't have to keep it
to yourself.

530
00:38:25,147 --> 00:38:26,678
It's Oh Yoon Hee.

531
00:38:27,577 --> 00:38:30,988
- What?
- The ghost singer was...

532
00:38:32,787 --> 00:38:34,318
Oh Yoon Hee.

533
00:38:34,557 --> 00:38:36,928
Was it really Oh Yoon Hee?

534
00:38:38,088 --> 00:38:40,698
What happened between you two?

535
00:38:44,698 --> 00:38:46,298
Joo Dan Tae.

536
00:38:47,497 --> 00:38:51,037
He did all of this to get
Cheong A Group in his hands?

537
00:38:54,037 --> 00:38:55,477
You're right.

538
00:38:57,247 --> 00:38:59,147
That's the kind of a man you were.

539
00:39:06,258 --> 00:39:10,258
Is everything you told me
about the night Ro Na died true?

540
00:39:11,187 --> 00:39:12,457
What do you mean?

541
00:39:12,457 --> 00:39:15,497
Is it true that I passed out
and was brought home?

542
00:39:16,327 --> 00:39:20,698
Of course. I have no reason
to lie to you.

543
00:39:22,138 --> 00:39:23,908
Why do you ask?

544
00:39:25,068 --> 00:39:29,178
Do you remember anything?

545
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:35,017
Why? Is there something
that I shouldn't remember?

546
00:39:47,827 --> 00:39:50,897
It's me. Where are you right now?

547
00:40:10,948 --> 00:40:14,088
What? Did you sleep here?

548
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:17,187
What's with the luggage?

549
00:40:17,528 --> 00:40:19,158
I left my home.

550
00:40:19,158 --> 00:40:21,028
And you're staying here?

551
00:40:21,028 --> 00:40:22,997
I'm busy with work anyway,
so it's better here.

552
00:40:22,997 --> 00:40:24,968
Booking a hotel is too much work.

553
00:40:25,368 --> 00:40:27,267
What happened with Oh Yoon Hee?

554
00:40:28,437 --> 00:40:30,107
I told her that I'd like a divorce.

555
00:40:31,107 --> 00:40:33,477
That doesn't mean that
I'll get back together with you.

556
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,908
I just feel too ashamed
to be with Yoon Hee.

557
00:40:37,548 --> 00:40:39,247
That's why I left her.

558
00:40:39,508 --> 00:40:40,877
Good job.

559
00:40:41,948 --> 00:40:44,147
You should start looking
for a place to stay first.

560
00:40:44,247 --> 00:40:46,048
You can't stay here forever.

561
00:40:46,457 --> 00:40:48,258
I'll take care of it.

562
00:40:49,287 --> 00:40:51,028
How's Eun Byeol?

563
00:40:52,028 --> 00:40:54,158
Are you sure her memory is gone?

564
00:40:54,357 --> 00:40:57,968
I'm making sure she takes
her pills, but I'm so anxious.

565
00:40:58,798 --> 00:41:01,568
She looks like she's starting
to remember something,

566
00:41:01,568 --> 00:41:03,437
and she won't talk to me.

567
00:41:05,267 --> 00:41:08,807
Are you eating well?

568
00:41:16,588 --> 00:41:19,787
You have to get through this
for Eun Byeol.

569
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:23,658
If you get shaken,
it's the end for Eun Byeol.

570
00:41:30,098 --> 00:41:31,667
What's with your hand?

571
00:41:32,598 --> 00:41:35,437
I think it's cramping.

572
00:41:37,508 --> 00:41:38,767
Did you...

573
00:41:39,437 --> 00:41:41,838
hurt your hand?
Is that what happened?

574
00:41:45,348 --> 00:41:47,848
Who are you? Why are you doing this?

575
00:41:47,848 --> 00:41:50,687
It looks like you put your hands
on the wrong woman.

576
00:41:50,687 --> 00:41:54,187
Who sent you?
Was it Joo Dan Tae? Jerk!

577
00:41:54,187 --> 00:41:55,787
Break his hands.

578
00:42:04,497 --> 00:42:06,738
Why are you telling me this now?

579
00:42:06,838 --> 00:42:08,468
This all happened because of me!

580
00:42:08,468 --> 00:42:11,408
It's not because of you.
No need to care. It's my business.

581
00:42:11,408 --> 00:42:14,138
It's mine too!

582
00:42:15,738 --> 00:42:18,147
I know what it took for you
to become a doctor...

583
00:42:19,008 --> 00:42:21,048
and how much you loved your job.

584
00:42:22,048 --> 00:42:24,048
It's all because of Joo Dan Tae.

585
00:42:24,647 --> 00:42:28,158
I can't stand this anymore.
That jerk!

586
00:42:28,557 --> 00:42:30,287
What are you going to do?

587
00:42:31,158 --> 00:42:34,098
I'm going to call
the wedding off right now.

588
00:42:34,098 --> 00:42:36,158
I never loved that man.

589
00:42:37,167 --> 00:42:40,198
I hated that you were always
longing for Yoon Hee,

590
00:42:40,537 --> 00:42:43,037
and I needed someone who'll
treat me like a lady.

591
00:42:43,468 --> 00:42:45,738
It's my fault for thinking
that it was love.

592
00:42:46,267 --> 00:42:48,037
If I marry him,

593
00:42:48,638 --> 00:42:50,707
Eun Byeol won't be happy either.

594
00:42:53,948 --> 00:42:55,417
I'm sorry...

595
00:42:56,888 --> 00:43:00,687
for giving you a hard time
because of a jerk like him.

596
00:43:02,118 --> 00:43:04,057
And I broke us.

597
00:43:05,888 --> 00:43:08,827
It's all in the past.
We can't turn anything back now.

598
00:43:08,827 --> 00:43:10,698
We can!

599
00:43:13,667 --> 00:43:16,368
I'm letting go of my ego
and asking you to come back.

600
00:43:24,207 --> 00:43:26,147
Please stay with me.

601
00:43:41,158 --> 00:43:42,957
I told you to not do that!

602
00:43:59,877 --> 00:44:01,348
You're late.

603
00:44:02,147 --> 00:44:03,818
Where were you?

604
00:44:05,448 --> 00:44:06,957
I almost fell asleep.

605
00:44:07,917 --> 00:44:08,988
Like you care?

606
00:44:15,227 --> 00:44:18,468
My fiancee couldn't be reached
late into the night.

607
00:44:18,667 --> 00:44:20,468
Of course, I was worried.

608
00:44:21,638 --> 00:44:24,207
What happened with
your dismissal matter?

609
00:44:24,707 --> 00:44:26,678
Should I meet the board members
and talk to them?

610
00:44:27,338 --> 00:44:29,377
What are you really after?

611
00:44:29,908 --> 00:44:32,848
For me to leave Cheong A Group
completely to you...

612
00:44:33,178 --> 00:44:36,448
and just be the high school director
until I grow old and die?

613
00:44:37,588 --> 00:44:39,187
Why are you so angry?

614
00:44:40,258 --> 00:44:41,357
I understand.

615
00:44:41,687 --> 00:44:43,187
Things are tough, aren't they?

616
00:44:44,827 --> 00:44:47,227
I heard you knew
Yoon Hee was my ghost singer.

617
00:44:47,598 --> 00:44:50,528
You're the one who ratted me out
to the foundation, aren't you?

618
00:44:51,227 --> 00:44:54,468
How dare you threaten my personal
assistant and do something so low?

619
00:44:54,468 --> 00:44:57,638
Why? Were you anxious
to get the merger through?

620
00:44:57,968 --> 00:45:00,977
You didn't want me,
you wanted Cheong A Group!

621
00:45:00,977 --> 00:45:02,937
Deny it if you can!

622
00:45:05,377 --> 00:45:06,448
Your family...

623
00:45:07,517 --> 00:45:10,048
is equally as obsessed with money.

624
00:45:12,017 --> 00:45:13,417
You scumbag.

625
00:45:15,388 --> 00:45:17,658
Now that I know
what kind of a jerk you are,

626
00:45:18,028 --> 00:45:19,727
I can't marry you.

627
00:45:20,298 --> 00:45:22,598
We're over.

628
00:45:24,468 --> 00:45:25,627
Get out!

629
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:41,917
Cheon Seo Jin.

630
00:45:44,348 --> 00:45:47,888
You'll regret doing that.

631
00:45:55,928 --> 00:45:57,468
Hello, Lawyer Park.

632
00:45:57,798 --> 00:46:01,468
I want to break off our engagement
as soon as possible.

633
00:46:01,698 --> 00:46:05,037
Please void the merger as well.

634
00:46:05,307 --> 00:46:07,437
It says in the agreement...

635
00:46:07,437 --> 00:46:10,278
that it will take effect
after the wedding.

636
00:46:12,577 --> 00:46:14,647
Yes. Thank you.

637
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:17,318
You need to come out for a minute.

638
00:46:18,948 --> 00:46:20,287
Detectives are here.

639
00:46:22,388 --> 00:46:23,488
Detectives?

640
00:46:33,738 --> 00:46:35,868
There are too many
eyes and ears in our home.

641
00:46:36,098 --> 00:46:37,937
Let's speak comfortably here.

642
00:46:38,238 --> 00:46:39,568
Why did you come...

643
00:46:40,477 --> 00:46:42,377
to speak with Eun Byeol?

644
00:46:43,338 --> 00:46:46,048
There are some things
we need to confirm with her...

645
00:46:46,048 --> 00:46:47,977
regarding Bae Ro Na's death.

646
00:46:47,977 --> 00:46:50,088
Isn't the case closed already?

647
00:46:50,488 --> 00:46:52,647
It's a shame that Ro Na died,

648
00:46:53,247 --> 00:46:56,158
but why must you speak
with Eun Byeol because of that?

649
00:46:56,957 --> 00:47:00,028
Because Eun Byeol is
our prime suspect.

650
00:47:00,258 --> 00:47:02,357
We've found solid evidence as well.

651
00:47:02,658 --> 00:47:03,667
Evidence?

652
00:47:04,827 --> 00:47:07,698
This necklace belongs
to your daughter, correct?

653
00:47:07,698 --> 00:47:09,767
We found her DNA...

654
00:47:09,767 --> 00:47:12,107
and the victim's blood on it.

655
00:47:14,678 --> 00:47:17,348
We already got
the janitor's confession...

656
00:47:17,348 --> 00:47:19,577
that he was paid
to give a false confession.

657
00:47:19,707 --> 00:47:23,647
Ha Yoon Chul is at the station
being questioned as we speak.

658
00:47:23,988 --> 00:47:26,618
Your daughter killed Bae Ro Na,
didn't she?

659
00:47:27,388 --> 00:47:31,258
The person who struck the victim
on the head with the trophy...

660
00:47:31,258 --> 00:47:32,588
was Ha Eun Byeol, wasn't it?

661
00:47:32,928 --> 00:47:35,028
You and Ha Yoon Chul tried
to cover that up...

662
00:47:35,028 --> 00:47:37,497
and send someone else
to take the fall!

663
00:47:44,437 --> 00:47:46,368
Did you kill Bae Ro Na
in the hospital...

664
00:47:46,908 --> 00:47:49,807
out of fear that the truth
would be revealed?

665
00:47:49,807 --> 00:47:50,807
No.

666
00:47:51,977 --> 00:47:52,977
No.

667
00:47:53,077 --> 00:47:54,218
Arrest Ha Eun Byeol!

668
00:47:54,218 --> 00:47:55,848
No! No.

669
00:47:57,118 --> 00:47:59,417
Eun Byeol did nothing wrong.

670
00:47:59,417 --> 00:48:00,818
I did it.

671
00:48:00,818 --> 00:48:01,988
I bribed Mr. Park.

672
00:48:01,988 --> 00:48:04,158
I killed Ro Na. I did it all.

673
00:48:04,158 --> 00:48:06,658
My Eun Byeol knows nothing.

674
00:48:07,758 --> 00:48:10,727
I'll kill you
if you touch my daughter!

675
00:48:11,798 --> 00:48:14,098
What an amazing motherly love.

676
00:48:14,868 --> 00:48:17,607
Your love for your daughter
and for your ex-husband.

677
00:48:18,908 --> 00:48:20,508
I'm all choked up.

678
00:48:20,908 --> 00:48:21,908
Dan Tae.

679
00:48:22,908 --> 00:48:24,307
- Chairman Joo.
- Yes.

680
00:48:24,307 --> 00:48:26,307
Take your men out for dinner.

681
00:48:26,307 --> 00:48:27,318
Thank you.

682
00:48:29,318 --> 00:48:31,287
Let's eat meat tonight.

683
00:48:31,287 --> 00:48:32,287
Yes, sir.

684
00:48:33,917 --> 00:48:35,618
- It was moving.
- Arrest Ha Eun Byeol!

685
00:48:35,618 --> 00:48:36,988
No! No.

686
00:48:36,988 --> 00:48:38,057
What a confession.

687
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:40,497
- Did you...
- Eun Byeol did nothing wrong.

688
00:48:40,497 --> 00:48:43,127
- I did it.
- Plan this?

689
00:48:43,298 --> 00:48:45,068
You want to break off
our engagement.

690
00:48:45,428 --> 00:48:46,428
Why?

691
00:48:46,897 --> 00:48:48,868
To go back to Ha Yoon Chul?

692
00:48:50,098 --> 00:48:51,207
How long has it been?

693
00:48:51,738 --> 00:48:55,008
Ever since the jerk returned
to Hera Palace?

694
00:48:55,607 --> 00:48:58,307
Or the night I shattered his hand?

695
00:48:58,307 --> 00:48:59,877
You scumbag.

696
00:49:03,247 --> 00:49:04,448
"You scumbag"?

697
00:49:06,048 --> 00:49:07,888
Did you think I wouldn't know...

698
00:49:07,888 --> 00:49:10,227
that you and that jerk...

699
00:49:13,457 --> 00:49:14,928
betrayed me in New York?

700
00:49:14,928 --> 00:49:15,928
Get away.

701
00:49:16,098 --> 00:49:17,327
Get away from me!

702
00:49:21,767 --> 00:49:24,068
Should I take this evidence...

703
00:49:24,537 --> 00:49:26,207
to the police now?

704
00:49:26,607 --> 00:49:28,477
No, no.

705
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:31,977
It would be much more fun
to send it to Oh Yoon Hee.

706
00:49:32,577 --> 00:49:34,747
If I let the woman
who lost her only child know...

707
00:49:34,747 --> 00:49:36,888
that her husband betrayed her
on top of that...

708
00:49:38,888 --> 00:49:42,187
I wonder how she'll rip you
and Eun Byeol to shreds...

709
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:43,557
and kill you.

710
00:49:45,158 --> 00:49:48,098
You've lost your mind.

711
00:49:52,428 --> 00:49:54,468
It's the price for betraying me.

712
00:49:54,568 --> 00:49:57,968
Did you not expect this much...

713
00:49:57,968 --> 00:50:00,377
when you decided to call off
our wedding?

714
00:50:01,477 --> 00:50:02,678
What should I do?

715
00:50:03,138 --> 00:50:07,517
What must I do to break
Eun Byeol's heart excruciatingly?

716
00:50:08,118 --> 00:50:10,218
You choose.

717
00:50:11,287 --> 00:50:12,287
I think...

718
00:50:13,588 --> 00:50:15,957
telling Oh Yoon Hee would be
the most fun.

719
00:50:15,957 --> 00:50:16,957
No.

720
00:50:17,388 --> 00:50:18,888
You can't do that! No.

721
00:50:18,888 --> 00:50:20,997
No. You can't do that! No.

722
00:50:21,198 --> 00:50:23,698
I'll do anything you say,

723
00:50:23,928 --> 00:50:25,167
so don't do anything.

724
00:50:25,698 --> 00:50:27,138
I'll do whatever you say,

725
00:50:27,437 --> 00:50:29,437
So please leave Eun Byeol alone.

726
00:50:29,598 --> 00:50:31,908
Please. I'm begging you. Please.

727
00:50:32,037 --> 00:50:33,037
Please.

728
00:50:34,408 --> 00:50:35,638
Can you...

729
00:50:36,738 --> 00:50:39,107
really do everything I say?

730
00:51:10,607 --> 00:51:11,607
What is this?

731
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:15,077
(Please join us
to celebrate our union.)

732
00:51:21,658 --> 00:51:22,818
What...

733
00:51:30,057 --> 00:51:31,397
What garbage...

734
00:51:36,238 --> 00:51:37,468
The phone is turned off...

735
00:51:46,607 --> 00:51:47,678
(Unit 8501, Paging)

736
00:51:52,718 --> 00:51:54,917
Seo Jin, open up. We need to talk.

737
00:51:55,718 --> 00:51:56,718
Seo Jin!

738
00:51:58,588 --> 00:52:00,227
Open up! We need to talk!

739
00:52:01,658 --> 00:52:03,227
Open up!

740
00:52:04,267 --> 00:52:05,468
Open up!

741
00:52:07,037 --> 00:52:09,667
We need to talk! We need to talk!

742
00:52:19,307 --> 00:52:20,417
Seo Jin.

743
00:52:20,917 --> 00:52:22,178
Seo Jin!

744
00:52:29,218 --> 00:52:30,218
Did you get it?

745
00:52:30,988 --> 00:52:32,658
The wedding invitation.

746
00:52:32,658 --> 00:52:34,928
I did. It's in two weeks.

747
00:52:35,758 --> 00:52:39,167
I didn't know
Chairman Joo would do this.

748
00:52:40,368 --> 00:52:42,767
He's insisting on getting married...

749
00:52:42,897 --> 00:52:44,767
after finding out
Seo Jin betrayed him.

750
00:52:45,838 --> 00:52:47,937
Is that how much he loves her?

751
00:52:48,238 --> 00:52:50,548
There must be an important reason...

752
00:52:50,548 --> 00:52:52,307
why he can't dump her.

753
00:52:53,678 --> 00:52:56,247
I have an appointment,
so I need to go.

754
00:52:56,917 --> 00:52:58,187
What appointment?

755
00:52:58,187 --> 00:52:59,917
You promised to tell me everything.

756
00:53:00,417 --> 00:53:01,417
Hello?

757
00:53:02,318 --> 00:53:04,287
- Hee? Hee.
- Hee?

758
00:53:07,857 --> 00:53:09,457
What?

759
00:53:09,897 --> 00:53:11,397
Hee?

760
00:53:12,167 --> 00:53:13,227
<i>Hee</i>

761
00:53:14,698 --> 00:53:17,968
<i>Please look at me</i>

762
00:53:21,178 --> 00:53:26,307
<i>You used to like me</i>

763
00:53:27,247 --> 00:53:29,017
<i>Hee</i>

764
00:53:30,178 --> 00:53:32,848
I'm sorry
I couldn't keep our appointment.

765
00:53:33,147 --> 00:53:35,988
But why did you want to meet...

766
00:53:35,988 --> 00:53:37,687
I'm sure you know.

767
00:53:37,988 --> 00:53:41,627
I want to know how you ended up
owning Hye In's land.

768
00:53:42,357 --> 00:53:44,468
She's my daughter.

769
00:53:44,627 --> 00:53:47,028
You mean, Su Ryeon's daughter.

770
00:53:49,167 --> 00:53:52,437
I guess you didn't get the notice
because Su Ryeon...

771
00:53:52,707 --> 00:53:54,707
gave the power of attorney
to someone else.

772
00:53:55,977 --> 00:53:59,908
True. You were never qualified
to be her dad.

773
00:54:00,008 --> 00:54:01,348
So it's only natural.

774
00:54:01,718 --> 00:54:04,818
There are no plans to develop
Cheonsoo District.

775
00:54:05,118 --> 00:54:08,218
Why did you want the land
in such a run-down area?

776
00:54:08,218 --> 00:54:11,388
Aren't you the one
who built Cheong A Art Center...

777
00:54:11,388 --> 00:54:12,888
in that district?

778
00:54:13,827 --> 00:54:17,627
You're quite greedy for someone
who just lost her child.

779
00:54:18,298 --> 00:54:22,937
Before, my biggest goal was
to raise my daughter well.

780
00:54:23,937 --> 00:54:27,437
But now that she's gone,

781
00:54:28,678 --> 00:54:30,437
my goal has changed.

782
00:54:31,848 --> 00:54:35,517
I want to become extremely wealthy.

783
00:54:38,488 --> 00:54:40,687
I'll do whatever it takes
to accumulate wealth...

784
00:54:40,687 --> 00:54:43,158
so that I can own this penthouse.

785
00:54:44,258 --> 00:54:47,127
Ro Na always wanted to live here.

786
00:54:48,327 --> 00:54:50,158
The penthouse?

787
00:54:50,428 --> 00:54:52,368
Why don't we make a bet?

788
00:54:52,968 --> 00:54:56,868
Who do you think
will be living here in a year?

789
00:55:01,107 --> 00:55:02,807
Ms. Cheon is here.

790
00:55:10,888 --> 00:55:12,517
Why are you so surprised?

791
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:16,158
I just stopped by to discuss
business. Don't get the wrong idea.

792
00:55:16,988 --> 00:55:20,127
I didn't know you were having
a guest. I'll come back later.

793
00:55:20,127 --> 00:55:23,798
You don't have to.
I was about to leave anyway.

794
00:55:25,227 --> 00:55:27,127
Eun Byeol, it's been a while.

795
00:55:27,698 --> 00:55:30,037
I heard that you were unwell.
Are you okay now?

796
00:55:30,037 --> 00:55:32,508
- Yes.
- That's a relief.

797
00:55:32,767 --> 00:55:34,738
It's so nice to see you
healthy again.

798
00:55:35,508 --> 00:55:38,377
Do you meet your dad often?

799
00:55:38,647 --> 00:55:40,618
Why would you ask that?

800
00:55:41,118 --> 00:55:43,178
It's just that I feel jealous.

801
00:55:43,948 --> 00:55:47,088
Ro Na grew up without her dad.

802
00:55:47,557 --> 00:55:50,988
And she can't even see
her new dad anymore...

803
00:55:51,758 --> 00:55:53,327
because she's dead.

804
00:56:00,028 --> 00:56:02,598
By the way, congratulations
on your wedding.

805
00:56:03,198 --> 00:56:05,037
Chairman Joo was kind enough...

806
00:56:05,037 --> 00:56:07,408
to send me an invitation.

807
00:56:07,738 --> 00:56:09,738
I'll see you at your wedding.

808
00:56:14,017 --> 00:56:16,917
What? Aren't you two
high school friends?

809
00:56:22,088 --> 00:56:24,127
We're having a wedding in two weeks.

810
00:56:24,127 --> 00:56:27,727
We're becoming family for real.
I hope everyone gets along.

811
00:56:30,497 --> 00:56:33,928
Nonsense. That's a stupid idea.

812
00:56:35,068 --> 00:56:37,807
I thought things were good again
between you and Dad.

813
00:56:39,368 --> 00:56:42,178
How much are you
going to hurt me again?

814
00:56:42,178 --> 00:56:44,877
At school, I have to put up
with kids pointing the finger at me.

815
00:56:44,877 --> 00:56:47,147
And now I have to put up with
you two getting married?

816
00:56:48,178 --> 00:56:51,318
Tell him right now.
Tell him that you can't marry him!

817
00:56:52,088 --> 00:56:53,747
This is...

818
00:56:55,118 --> 00:56:56,488
my choice.

819
00:56:56,488 --> 00:56:59,488
I guess you're not ready
to accept me as your dad yet.

820
00:57:00,127 --> 00:57:03,158
It's okay. We can get used
to each other from now on.

821
00:57:03,158 --> 00:57:04,798
I hate it.

822
00:57:05,298 --> 00:57:07,667
I'll never accept this marriage.

823
00:57:12,037 --> 00:57:14,508
I agree with Eun Byeol for once.

824
00:57:14,678 --> 00:57:17,807
I'll never accept
this ridiculous marriage either.

825
00:57:19,707 --> 00:57:23,477
Congratulations.
You two are perfect for each other.

826
00:57:33,057 --> 00:57:35,028
- This is insane!
- Sit back down.

827
00:57:35,028 --> 00:57:36,698
Please stop.

828
00:57:36,798 --> 00:57:38,397
If you want money,

829
00:57:38,397 --> 00:57:41,267
I'll compensate you as much
as you want, so please...

830
00:57:41,267 --> 00:57:42,968
Cut it out!

831
00:57:45,307 --> 00:57:48,107
In this game, you have no choice.

832
00:57:48,107 --> 00:57:50,138
I get to decide whether
we get married or not.

833
00:57:50,278 --> 00:57:52,577
All you have to do is
move into this penthouse...

834
00:57:52,577 --> 00:57:55,377
as my wife on the day I choose.
Understood?

835
00:57:56,548 --> 00:57:57,888
Ms. Ahn.

836
00:57:58,747 --> 00:58:00,147
Yes, sir.

837
00:58:00,147 --> 00:58:01,658
Call the dress shop
and tell them we're coming.

838
00:58:01,658 --> 00:58:02,917
Sure, sir.

839
00:58:36,787 --> 00:58:39,857
Try this on.
I think it'll look gorgeous on you.

(Cheong A Arts High School)

841
00:58:52,707 --> 00:58:53,868
(The 28th Cheong A Art Festival)

842
00:58:54,937 --> 00:58:56,838
What took you so long?

843
00:58:56,838 --> 00:58:58,377
- Stop!
- Ro Na!

844
00:58:58,377 --> 00:59:00,307
- Mom!
- Jenny!

845
00:59:00,307 --> 00:59:01,448
(Fire alarm)

846
00:59:05,848 --> 00:59:07,457
Fire!

847
00:59:14,997 --> 00:59:16,557
Bae Ro Na.

848
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:20,327
Thanks to her,
things have become a lot simpler.

849
00:59:23,397 --> 00:59:26,508
I would thank her,

850
00:59:27,138 --> 00:59:28,807
but I can't.

851
00:59:32,247 --> 00:59:33,477
It's me, Secretary Do.

852
00:59:33,477 --> 00:59:36,077
Go to my place and get
me and Eun Byeol's passports.

853
00:59:36,077 --> 00:59:38,787
And book us
the first flight tonight.

854
00:59:38,787 --> 00:59:40,588
The destination doesn't matter.

855
00:59:43,917 --> 00:59:45,388
(Passport)

856
00:59:45,388 --> 00:59:46,658
Are you looking for these?

857
00:59:46,658 --> 00:59:49,357
What? Are you disappointed?

858
00:59:50,057 --> 00:59:53,497
Did you think
I wouldn't prepare this much?

859
00:59:54,868 --> 00:59:58,008
Let's not waste each other's energy.

860
00:59:58,008 --> 01:00:02,238
Wherever you go, I'll find you.

861
01:00:07,377 --> 01:00:08,747
Are you okay?

862
01:00:22,198 --> 01:00:24,698
No, not this.

863
01:00:31,107 --> 01:00:32,537
I don't think it's for you.

864
01:00:34,338 --> 01:00:36,937
This looks a bit funny too.

865
01:00:40,948 --> 01:00:42,778
Why don't you just kill me now?

866
01:00:49,158 --> 01:00:51,158
She must not be so happy
with the dresses.

867
01:00:51,158 --> 01:00:53,557
She seems very upset.

868
01:00:53,957 --> 01:00:57,357
She has pretty high standards.
Can you show her some other designs?

869
01:00:57,357 --> 01:00:59,198
You're crazy.

870
01:00:59,568 --> 01:01:01,838
You disgusting jerk.

871
01:01:16,247 --> 01:01:18,848
- What's this?
- A present.

872
01:01:26,327 --> 01:01:28,457
This is totally my style.

873
01:01:29,327 --> 01:01:31,098
Did something good happen today?

874
01:01:31,698 --> 01:01:34,368
The best thing that happened is
that you came back.

875
01:01:34,368 --> 01:01:36,238
I missed you so much.

876
01:01:36,267 --> 01:01:39,207
You're being so sweet today.

877
01:01:41,908 --> 01:01:43,908
- I'll go change.
- Okay.

878
01:01:48,948 --> 01:01:51,588
I wonder how Joo Dan Tae
really feels.

879
01:01:51,747 --> 01:01:55,057
Is she special to him because
she gave birth to his children?

880
01:01:55,687 --> 01:01:59,727
Even a monster like him
can love someone sincerely?

881
01:02:00,327 --> 01:02:01,857
It's hard to believe.

882
01:02:03,028 --> 01:02:04,327
Something doesn't feel right.

883
01:02:04,327 --> 01:02:06,428
Two years ago,
Na Ae Gyo was determined...

884
01:02:06,528 --> 01:02:09,068
to escape from Joo Dan Tae.

885
01:02:10,167 --> 01:02:13,107
They're completely on the same side.

886
01:02:13,107 --> 01:02:16,178
I don't care.
We don't have much time.

887
01:02:16,437 --> 01:02:18,577
I have to meet Ae Gyo and ask her...

888
01:02:18,678 --> 01:02:20,977
what Joo Dan Tae did to Su Ryeon.

889
01:02:23,147 --> 01:02:24,948
I won't make another mistake.

890
01:02:25,618 --> 01:02:29,187
What was going on
between you and Su Ryeon?

891
01:02:30,318 --> 01:02:33,227
Seol A's birth mother
and stepbrother.

892
01:02:34,698 --> 01:02:36,598
Nothing more?

893
01:02:39,127 --> 01:02:40,497
I wanted...

894
01:02:42,068 --> 01:02:44,098
to make her happy.

895
01:02:45,468 --> 01:02:48,008
I should have protected her
no matter what.

896
01:02:50,877 --> 01:02:52,477
I was such a fool.

897
01:02:54,747 --> 01:02:56,877
I can't forgive myself.

898
01:03:02,787 --> 01:03:05,357
All my apartments sold out.

899
01:03:05,557 --> 01:03:07,258
At the highest prices.

900
01:03:07,258 --> 01:03:09,258
Is that why you look so happy?

901
01:03:10,357 --> 01:03:12,997
It's a stellar location,
so it's no surprise.

902
01:03:13,198 --> 01:03:16,167
The prices may go up even more.
Why did you sell them already?

903
01:03:17,397 --> 01:03:19,037
The prices are at
their peak right now.

904
01:03:19,037 --> 01:03:21,037
The district will be designated
as a speculative zone soon,

905
01:03:21,437 --> 01:03:23,307
preventing people from taking loans.

906
01:03:24,107 --> 01:03:25,577
How many people
do you think can pay...

907
01:03:25,577 --> 01:03:27,848
tens of millions of dollars
without taking loans?

908
01:03:27,848 --> 01:03:31,687
I guess Mr. Jung is still providing
you with useful information.

909
01:03:31,687 --> 01:03:34,147
And I have you to thank for that.

910
01:03:34,147 --> 01:03:37,357
You're the perfect partner for me.
You have been for the past 20 years.

911
01:03:37,357 --> 01:03:39,127
You just now realized that?

912
01:03:43,457 --> 01:03:45,968
Come to think of it,
I feel sorry for Su Ryeon.

913
01:03:47,497 --> 01:03:51,207
In her whole life, she knew
so little about her own husband.

914
01:03:53,138 --> 01:03:56,377
I wouldn't want to talk about her
on a happy day like today.

915
01:03:57,238 --> 01:04:00,678
We have only one bullet left each.
I'll go first.

916
01:04:04,917 --> 01:04:06,388
Are you getting nervous?

917
01:04:06,388 --> 01:04:07,888
Look who's talking.

918
01:04:14,127 --> 01:04:16,057
Tell me the truth.

919
01:04:16,258 --> 01:04:18,767
You tried to betray me
two years ago, didn't you?

920
01:04:18,767 --> 01:04:19,767
What are you doing?

921
01:04:19,767 --> 01:04:20,928
Tell me!

922
01:04:21,298 --> 01:04:22,767
You can't fool me.

923
01:04:23,037 --> 01:04:25,338
I knew from the get-go
that you had changed.

924
01:04:25,338 --> 01:04:27,607
You wouldn't take my calls,
you wouldn't come back...

925
01:04:27,607 --> 01:04:29,838
There must have been a reason why
you avoided me.

926
01:04:30,278 --> 01:04:31,548
What are you up to?

927
01:04:32,048 --> 01:04:33,678
Were you planning to leave me?

928
01:04:36,077 --> 01:04:38,048
Shoot me if you can.

929
01:04:39,187 --> 01:04:42,357
If you think you can keep
your fortune without me,

930
01:04:43,218 --> 01:04:44,218
shoot me.

931
01:04:45,488 --> 01:04:47,127
You scumbag.

932
01:04:47,158 --> 01:04:49,798
Whoever dares to betray me will die.

933
01:04:50,227 --> 01:04:52,198
You are no exception.

934
01:05:17,118 --> 01:05:18,727
Don't die, Mom.

935
01:05:18,727 --> 01:05:21,298
No. No. No.

936
01:05:21,428 --> 01:05:23,258
No. No!

937
01:05:27,068 --> 01:05:28,068
No.

938
01:05:29,468 --> 01:05:30,497
No.

939
01:05:31,468 --> 01:05:32,537
No.

940
01:05:34,107 --> 01:05:35,238
No.

941
01:05:35,738 --> 01:05:36,937
No!

942
01:05:52,357 --> 01:05:53,357
Sir!

943
01:05:55,528 --> 01:05:56,557
What happened?

944
01:05:57,127 --> 01:05:58,267
Wake up.

945
01:06:01,368 --> 01:06:02,698
Na Ae Gyo is gone.

946
01:06:03,667 --> 01:06:05,508
- Find her!
- Yes, sir.

947
01:06:16,377 --> 01:06:17,577
Wake up.

948
01:06:17,618 --> 01:06:18,718
Open your eyes!

949
01:06:23,318 --> 01:06:24,388
She's not breathing.

950
01:06:24,457 --> 01:06:25,457
What?

951
01:06:26,588 --> 01:06:28,227
We have to get out of here.

952
01:06:28,227 --> 01:06:29,397
We have no time. Hurry!

953
01:07:20,607 --> 01:07:23,318
(The Penthouse 2)

954
01:07:23,318 --> 01:07:25,017
You're marrying Chairman Joo?

955
01:07:25,017 --> 01:07:27,287
I told you.
You can never be free of me.

956
01:07:27,287 --> 01:07:29,818
Leave before the wedding!

957
01:07:29,818 --> 01:07:31,017
Our mom's killer...

958
01:07:31,017 --> 01:07:32,357
I found out.

959
01:07:32,357 --> 01:07:35,298
I'll kill you, Joo Dan Tae!

960
01:07:35,298 --> 01:07:36,298
Trophy?

961
01:07:36,298 --> 01:07:38,068
What if I really end up going crazy?

962
01:07:38,068 --> 01:07:40,428
Seok Hoon, Seok Kyung,
your biological mom is alive.

963
01:07:40,428 --> 01:07:41,767
Oh Yoon Hee? You again?

964
01:07:41,767 --> 01:07:44,437
Would you trust the person
who tried to kill you?

965
01:07:44,437 --> 01:07:45,807
You meant it.

966
01:07:45,807 --> 01:07:47,508
I know it's you!
